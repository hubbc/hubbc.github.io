# Hubbc Page
I'm using this to make my own dynamic QR codes by:
a. Having a generic index.html that immediately redirects
b. Make a QR code for that url
c. I can update the url link manually now, but eventually I'd like to add more features see.

# Uses
I want to make dynamic QR codes but I don't want to purchase a subscription or rely on other sites' existence for them to stay for years. I believe that GitHub Pages is the best way to do this and as far as I could tell from the terms and conditions, this isn't against any rules. Particularly, I am planning on getting a tattoo of one or more of these codes so I am *really* relying on this being allowed. I think this is a fun idea and is better than getting a static QR code that is a rickroll because I can make it a rickroll whenever I want, but also my linkedin profile for interviews. 

# Future 
[ ] Add some amount of statistics. Number of links, location?, etc.
[ ] Add a way that I can change the redirect on the go. Text, mobile app, microcontroller, etc.
[ ] Allow a "wheel of fortune" feature for random redirects
[ ] Schedule redirect times to sync with calendar?
